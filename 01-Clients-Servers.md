# Part 1: The Players (Clients and Servers)

Before we look at how data moves, we must understand the two main "actors" in this digital system. The internet is essentially a massive network of computers talking to one another.

## 1. The Client
The **Client** is the device *asking* for information.
* **Example:** Your laptop, your smartphone, or your smart fridge.
* **The Tool:** The client usually uses a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) to make requests.

## 2. The Server
The **Server** is the computer *providing* the information.
* **Example:** A powerful computer sitting in a data center owned by Google, Amazon, or a small business.
* **The Job:** The server stores the website files (images, text, code) and waits for a client to ask for them.

> **Analogy:** Imagine a restaurant. You (the **Client**) look at a menu and order food. The Kitchen (the **Server**) prepares the food and hands it to you.
